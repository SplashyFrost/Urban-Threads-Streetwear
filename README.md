# Urban-Threads-Streetwear
Urban Threads is a static front-end demo of a compact streetwear storefront built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases a modern monochrome UI with subtle glass (backdrop-blur) effects and soft blurred color accents, responsive navigation with mobile menu, an accessible loading spinner, and a simple shop with product cards (demo only)
